# OpenCVAlgorithms

This application has the intent to evaluate some OpenCV Algorithms in a mobile Android application. The algorithms used are SIFT, KAZE, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB.

The application uses the OpenCV Java SDK version 4.5.5.

## Application Capabilities
Detect, describe and match features from a given image to a live video feed.

Benchmark key metrics for each process.

## Inspiration
Thanks to [Akshika Wijesundara](https://github.com/akshika47/OpenCV-Android-Object-Detection) for providing a guiding baseline on how to capture the live camera feed with the OpenCV camera.
